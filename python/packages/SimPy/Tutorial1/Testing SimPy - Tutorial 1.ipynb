    "Our car process requires a reference to an Environment (env) in order to create new events. The car‘s behavior is described in an infinite loop. Remember, this function is a generator. Though it will never terminate, it will pass the control flow back to the simulation once a yield statement is reached. Once the yielded event is triggered (“it occurs”), the simulation will resume the function at this statement.\n",

    "As I said before, our car switches between the states parking and driving. It announces its new state by printing a message and the current simulation time (as returned by the Environment.now property). It then calls the Environment.timeout() factory function to create a Timeout event. This event describes the point in time the car is done parking (or driving, respectively). By yielding the event, it signals the simulation that it wants to wait for the event to occur."
